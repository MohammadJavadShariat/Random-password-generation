# Random-password-generation
Hello!
This program is a random password generation program.
At first, you will be asked if you want a password to be created for you.
If you say no, the program ends.
If you say yes, the program will ask your name in English.
Then the program creates a normal password for you, consisting of four numbers, two uppercase letters, two lowercase letters and a symbol.
In the next line, a special password will be created for you, which includes your English name in addition to the above.
After this, the program will start again and if you want another password, you can continue again and if you are satisfied with this password, enter no until the program ends.
I hope our program can help you create a safe and good passwordðŸ˜Š
